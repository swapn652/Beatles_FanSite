        In the late 1950s, John Lennon formed a group called the Quarrymen,
        which later became the Beatles. Paul McCartney and George Harrison
        joined the band, and they gained popularity in Liverpool and Hamburg.
        Brian Epstein became their manager and secured a recording contract with
        EMI's Parlophone label. They released their first single, "Love Me Do,"
        and their success grew under Epstein's guidance. They replaced drummer
        Pete Best with Ringo Starr and adopted a more professional approach to
        performing.

        The Beatles, a legendary British rock band formed in the 1960s,
        revolutionized the concept of rock albums with groundbreaking releases
        like "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band." They ventured into film
        projects such as "Magical Mystery Tour" and "Yellow Submarine." In 1968,
        they traveled to India for meditation, resulting in the prolific "White
        Album." However, tensions within the band grew, leading to strained
        relationships. They also established Apple Corps, a multimedia
        corporation. Despite their diverse musical styles showcased in albums
        like "The White Album" and "Abbey Road," the recording sessions for "Let
        It Be" were marked by conflict. The Beatles eventually disbanded in
        1970, leaving behind a lasting legacy of musical inspiration.

          In 1963, the Beatles recorded their debut album "Please Please Me" in
          a single day. The album and their subsequent singles achieved great
          success in the UK, leading to their first nationwide tour and the rise
          of "Beatlemania". The Beatles' popularity spread to the United States,
          where they made a groundbreaking appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show,
          sparking the British Invasion of music. Their first visit to the US
          coincided with the nation's mourning of President Kennedy's
          assassination and reignited a sense of excitement among the youth. The
          Beatles' film "A Hard Day's Night" further solidified their success.
          They continued touring internationally and met Bob Dylan, leading to a
          mutual influence on each other's music. The band also took a stand
          against racial segregation in the US.

          In the 1970s, the Beatles disbanded, and each member pursued solo
          careers. John Lennon had successful albums but was tragically
          assassinated. Paul McCartney formed Wings and had hits like "Band on
          the Run." George Harrison had solo success, including "My Sweet Lord."
          Ringo Starr released albums and acted. In the 1980s, McCartney and
          Harrison had hits, and Starr released albums. The 1990s saw a Beatles
          resurgence with the "Anthology" project. McCartney, Harrison, and
          Starr collaborated on new tracks. In the 2000s, McCartney, Harrison,
          and Starr released solo music. Harrison passed away in 2001. McCartney
          and Starr continued performing and honoring the Beatles' legacy. In
          the 2010s, they remained active and influential in the music industry.
